Basic Datatypes:
char, short 1 byte
int 2 bytes
float, long 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
long double 10 bytes
--------------------
What is a pointer on pointer?
A: It’s a pointer variable which can hold the address of another pointer variable
-------------------
Distinguish between malloc() & calloc() memory allocation
A: calloc() and malloc() are dynamic memory allocating functions. 
The only difference between them is that calloc() will load 
all the assigned memory locations with value 0 but malloc() will not.
------------------
What is keyword auto for?
A: By default every local variable of the function is automatic (auto).
These variables allocates memory automatically upon entry to that block 
and free the occupied memory upon exit from that block.
------------------
What are the valid places for the keyword break to appear?
A: Break can appear only with in the looping control and switch statement. 
The purpose of the break is to bring the control out from the said blocks.
------------------
Explain the syntax for for loop.
Syntex: 
for(expression-1;expression-2;expression-3) {
   //set of statements
}
A: When control reaches for expression-1 is executed first. 
Then following expression-2, and if expression-2 evaluates
to non-zero ‘set of statements’ and expression-3 is executed,
follows expression-2
-----------------
What is difference between including the header 
file with-in angular braces < > and double quotes ""?
A: If a header file is included with in < > then the compiler searches 
for the particular header file only with in the built in include path. 
If a header file is included with in “ “, then the compiler 
searches for the particular header file first in the current working directory, 
if not found then in the built in include path.
-----------------
How a negative integer is stored?
A: Get the two’s compliment of the same positive integer. Eg: 1011 (-5)
Step-1 − One’s compliment of 5 : 1010
Step-2 − Add 1 to above, giving 1011, which is -5
-----------------
What is a static variable?
A: A static local variables retains its value between
the function call and the default value is 0
 ***If a global variable is static then 
    its visibility is limited to the same source code.
-----------------
What is a NULL pointer?
A: A pointer pointing to nothing is called NULL pointer. Eg: char *p=NULL
-----------------
What is the purpose of extern storage specifier?
A: extern specifier is used to declare a global variable that is a variable without 
any memory assigned to it. It is used to declare variables and functions in header files
-----------------
Explain the purpose of the function sprintf()
A: Prints the formatted output onto the character array.
-----------------
What is the meaning of base address of the array?
A: The starting address of the array is called as the base address of the array.
-----------------
When should we use the register storage specifier?
A: If a variable is used most frequently then it should be 
declared using register storage specifier, 
then possibly the compiler gives CPU register 
for its storage to speed up the look up of the variable.
-----------------
S++ or S = S+1, which can be recommended to increment the value by 1 and why?
A: S++, as it is single machine instruction (INC) internally.
-----------------
What is a dangling pointer?
A: A pointer initially holding valid address, 
but later the held address is released or freed. 
Then such a pointer is called as dangling pointer.
-----------------
What is the purpose of the keyword typedef?
A: This keyword is used to redefine the name of an already existing variable.
-----------------
What is lvalue and rvalue?
A: An lvalue (locator value) represents an object 
that occupies some identifiable location in memory
an rvalue is an expression //that does not represent
an object occupying some identifiable location in memory
