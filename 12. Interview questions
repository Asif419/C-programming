Basic Datatypes:
char, short 1 byte
int 2 bytes
float, long 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
long double 10 bytes
--------------------
What is a pointer on pointer?
A: It’s a pointer variable which can hold the address of another pointer variable
-------------------
Distinguish between malloc() & calloc() memory allocation
A: calloc() and malloc() are dynamic memory allocating functions. 
The only difference between them is that calloc() will load 
all the assigned memory locations with value 0 but malloc() will not.
------------------
What is keyword auto for?
A: By default every local variable of the function is automatic (auto).
These variables allocates memory automatically upon entry to that block 
and free the occupied memory upon exit from that block.
------------------
What are the valid places for the keyword break to appear?
A: Break can appear only with in the looping control and switch statement. 
The purpose of the break is to bring the control out from the said blocks.
------------------
Explain the syntax for for loop.
Syntex: 
for(expression-1;expression-2;expression-3) {
   //set of statements
}
A: When control reaches for expression-1 is executed first. 
Then following expression-2, and if expression-2 evaluates
to non-zero ‘set of statements’ and expression-3 is executed,
follows expression-2
-----------------
What is difference between including the header 
file with-in angular braces < > and double quotes ""?
A: If a header file is included with in < > then the compiler searches 
for the particular header file only with in the built in include path. 
If a header file is included with in “ “, then the compiler 
searches for the particular header file first in the current working directory, 
if not found then in the built in include path.
-----------------
How a negative integer is stored?
A: Get the two’s compliment of the same positive integer. Eg: 1011 (-5)
Step-1 − One’s compliment of 5 : 1010
Step-2 − Add 1 to above, giving 1011, which is -5
-----------------
What is a static variable?
A: A static local variables retains its value between
the function call and the default value is 0
 ***If a global variable is static then 
    its visibility is limited to the same source code.
