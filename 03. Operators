Arithmetic Operators:
    +	addition or unary plus
    -	subtraction or unary minus
    *	multiplication
    /	division
    %	remainder after division (modulo division)
| Example:
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
      int a = 9,b = 4, c;

      c = a+b;
      printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
      c = a-b;
      printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
      c = a*b;
      printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
      c = a/b;
      printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
      c = a%b;
      printf("Remainder when a divided by b = %d \n",c);

      return 0;
  }



Increment and Decrement Operators:
  ++
  --



Assignment Operators:
  =   	a = b	    a = b
  +=	  a += b	  a = a+b
  -=	  a -= b	  a = a-b
  *=	  a *= b	  a = a*b
  /=	  a /= b	  a = a/b
  %=	  a %= b	  a = a%b



Relational Operators:
  ==	  Equal to          	      5 == 3 is evaluated to 0
  >	    Greater than            	5 > 3 is evaluated to 1
  <	    Less than	                5 < 3 is evaluated to 0
  !=	  Not equal to	            5 != 3 is evaluated to 1
  >=	  Greater than or equal to	5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1
  <=	  Less than or equal to	    5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0



Logical Operators:
  && and
  || or
  ! not



sizeof Operator:
|
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
      int a;
      float b;
      double c;
      char d;
      printf("Size of int=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(a));
      printf("Size of float=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(b));
      printf("Size of double=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(c));
      printf("Size of char=%lu byte\n",sizeof(d));

      return 0;
  }
